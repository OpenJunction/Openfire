/**
 * Represents a form that could be use for gathering data as well as for reporting data
 * returned from a search.
 * <p/>
 * The form could be of the following types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>form -> Indicates a form to fill out.</li>
 * <li>submit -> The form is filled out, and this is the data that is being returned from
 * the form.</li>
 * <li>cancel -> The form was cancelled. Tell the asker that piece of information.</li>
 * <li>result -> Data results being returned from a search, or some other query.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * In case the form represents a search, the report will be structured in columns and rows. Use
 * {@link #addReportedField(FormField)} to set the columns of the report whilst the report's rows
 * can be configured using {@link #addItemFields(ArrayList)}.
