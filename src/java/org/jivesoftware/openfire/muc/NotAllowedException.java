 * Exception used for representing that the user is not allowed to perform the requested operation 
 * in the MUCRoom. There are many reasons why a not-allowed error could occur such as: a user tries 
 * to join a room that has reached its limit of max number of occupants. A 405 error code is 
 * returned to the user that requested the invalid operation.
