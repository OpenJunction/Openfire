/**
 * A SocketReader specialized for server connections. This reader will be used when the open
 * stream contains a jabber:server namespace. Server-to-server communication requires two
 * TCP connections between the servers where one is used for sending packets whilst the other
 * connection is used for receiving packets. The connection used for receiving packets will use
 * a ServerSocketReader since the other connection will not receive packets.<p>
 *
 * The received packets will be routed using another thread to ensure that many received packets
 * could be routed at the same time. To avoid creating new threads every time a packet is received
 * each <tt>ServerSocketReader</tt> instance uses a {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}. By default the
 * maximum number of threads that the executor may have is 50. However, this value may be modified
 * by changing the property <b>xmpp.server.processing.max.threads</b>.
