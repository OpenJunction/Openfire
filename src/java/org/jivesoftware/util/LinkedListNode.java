/**
 * Doubly linked node in a LinkedList. Most LinkedList implementations keep the
 * equivalent of this class private. We make it public so that references
 * to each node in the list can be maintained externally.
 * <p/>
 * Exposing this class lets us make remove operations very fast. Remove is
 * built into this class and only requires two reference reassignments. If
 * remove existed in the main LinkedList class, a linear scan would have to
 * be performed to find the correct node to delete.
 * <p/>
 * The linked list implementation was specifically written for the Jive
 * cache system. While it can be used as a general purpose linked list, for
 * most applications, it is more suitable to use the linked list that is part
 * of the Java Collections package.
